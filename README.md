# Web-Scraping-Understat.com

This gives an example of scraping individual player shot data from Understat.com. If you need to scrape data for plotting, simply change the base_url parameter to a string containing the link you wish to scrape from. I have also included a data visualization to demonstrate the type of data that was scraped.
